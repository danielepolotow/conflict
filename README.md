# Armed Conflict - Brazil 2020

In this notebook, I'm going to plot conflict data from Brazil in a map. This article won’t go over exploratory analysis of the dataset. We’ll be using all of Bokeh, Pandas, and Numpy in this project.

The data used here whas collected by ACLED. ACLED collects real-time data on the locations, dates, actors, fatalities, and types of all reported political violence and protest events across Africa, the Middle East, Latin America & the Caribbean, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia & the Caucasus, Europe, and the United States of America.
